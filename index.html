<p>A little of everything! RAM Hacks welcomes people of all majors and practices to join together and discuss their interest in computers and electronics. We allow students to showcase personal projects, discuss homework questions, and organize movie and game nights.</p>

<p>Our current goals for the semester are to bring the webforums back online, deploy a chat service for students to communicate through, showcase more student projects, continue to assist new members with homework, watch more movies together, and more importantly, continue to grow as a community around a common interest.</p>

<p>Absolutely! No official invitation is needed. Simply show up to the meetings and start taking part! If you can't make the meetings, consider emailing the administration. Our times are flexible and can be adjusted if an overwhelming majority is not able to meet on the set days.</p>
